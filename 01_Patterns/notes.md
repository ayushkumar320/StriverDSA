# Pattern Printing Key points
- Patterns are usually printed using nested loops.
- For the outer loop, we decide the number of rows (number of lines).
- For the inner loop, we decide the number of columns and connect them somehow to the rows.
- Print the pattern using the appropriate characters (e.g., *, #, etc.) based on the row and column indices inside the inner loop.
